    "The data is a results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy, but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.\n",

    "It was made available on the UCI Machine Learning repository for exploratory data analysis and classification. [Source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)\n",

    "## Data wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explain how to use Pandas to wrangle our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is data wrangling? Data wrangling the process of transforming and mapping data from one \"raw\" data form into another format, with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why Pandas? \n",
    "Pandas is a Python library developed specifically for data analysis, that allows you to easily: \n",
    "- Select and filter your dataset. \n",
    "- Automate the cleaning of your datasets, e.g. missing values. \n",
    "- Merge & transform datasets\n",
    "- Split-apply-combine: the ability to chunk your data set into pieces, apply a function, and place it back together is the number one reason to use Pandas. \n",
    "- Handling time series operations. Pandas is amazing at converting to different periods, resampling, etc are a brilliant feature.\n",
    "- Speed: When working with large datasets, it is much faster than tools like excel.\n",
